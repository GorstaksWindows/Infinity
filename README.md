# Infinity
It was my intention to create a script fit for any kind of a party member, a script with which a character will fight smart, use potions if necessary, use spells when needed, turn undead, look for traps, backstab and all the other fancy stuff. Furthermore, it was my intention that the script should be compatible with any baldur or icewind dale game, and it should not cheat no matter what. I took universal script made by Rich Martel, found on Sorcerers Place website, and heavily modified it to suit my needs. I'm happy with what I have achieved, and am willing to share, although this was meant only for me originally.

Installation instructions:

Download and extract the zip file, and copy file with BS extension into scripts subfolder where your game is installed. Then inside the game, click on character screen/customize/script and then scroll to bottom and pick this script. You need to repeat the latter for every party member.

Any feedback is more then welcome, even rants about how this is not the way the game should be played
